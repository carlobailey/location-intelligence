## Week-2:
### Define a research agenda and create a Reveal.js presentation


#### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to have you start thinking about a research agenda for your final project. One of the hardest things about research and data science is not any of the technical aspects (getting the data, analysis, making visualizations, etc), but is asking the right questions. You can have all the data in the world and all the time + resources to explore it, but if you do not know how to ask interesting questions, you will not be able to produce novel insights, actionable findings or a new body of knowledge. In this assignment you will be tasked with coming up with a research question(s) that you want to answer over the next few weeks/months, gather existing research on the topic, and present with Reveal.js.

Reveal.js is an open-source presentation framework that enables you to create interactive, highly customisable presentations on the web. Alongside doing visualization and analysis in Python, you will be consolidating your efforts this semester in Reveal.js. This assignment aims to get you familiar with the framework.

#### Task
Define a broad topic or area of interest related to the built environment or design authorities. For example property ownership, zoning, energy usage etc.
Why are you interested in this topic?
Narrow it down to an area within the above broad topic that you wish to explore.
What are the ways you think this topic affects the built environment?
Write your proposed research question, based on the narrowing down of the above topic areas.
What do you hope to uncover?

*Example: 1*
Broad Topic
- Real Estate Financing
Narrow Area
- Public Infrastructure and Land Value
Research Question
- How does the development of public infrastructure projects affect house prices?

*Example: 2*
Broad Topic
- Human Health
Narrow Area
- Food Access and Neighborhood Amenities
Research Question
- How does the availability of healthy foods in neighborhoods influence community BMI?

*Example: 3*
Broad Topic
- Local Economy
Narrow Area
- Multinational Chains and Small Business
Research Question
- How can the built environment support or retard business growth of each type? How does it affect local employment?
