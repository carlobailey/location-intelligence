## Week-3:
### Data manipulation with Pandas

#### Purpose
The goal of this assignment is to get you coding in Python and familiar with the Pandas library. You are tasked with locating a dataset on your chosen research topic and load the data in Python using Pandas. Once the data is loaded into Python you must describe the data using basic statistics such as averages, medians, summing, etc. For example, if your topic is NYC housing, then you could download the building data from the NYC Urban Planning department (PLUTO), load it into Pandas and find out the average building height in NYC or the total square footage in Manhattan.

There are many interesting datasets online and I encourage you to search the internet to locate something interesting. Most research is only as good as the available data.

Resources:
- You may find the datasets linked in the [resource](https://www.placedata.net/resources/) section of this site useful.
- Refer to the intro [tutorials](https://www.placedata.net/posts/) or [notebooks](https://github.com/carlobailey/location-intelligence/tree/main/_notebooks) on Python, Pandas, and Data.

## Week-2:
### Define a research agenda and create a Reveal.js presentation


#### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about a research agenda for your final project. One of the hardest things about research and data science is finding the right questions to ask with data. You can have all the data in the world, with unlimited time and resources, but if you do not know how to ask interesting questions, you will not be able to produce novel insights, actionable findings or a new body of knowledge. In this assignment you will be tasked with coming up with a research question(s) that you want to answer over the next few weeks/months, gather existing research on the topic, and present it with Reveal.js.

[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) is an open-source presentation framework that enables you to create interactive, highly customizable presentations on the web. Alongside doing visualization and analysis in Python, you will be consolidating your efforts this semester in Reveal.js. This assignment aims to get you familiar with the framework.

#### Task
Define a broad topic or area of interest related to the built environment or location. For example property ownership, zoning, energy usage, retailers, tax credits, etc. Why are you interested in this topic? Narrow it down further to an area you wish to explore. What are the ways you think this topic affects the built environment and location? Articulate your proposed research question, and find 2-3 examples of academic or industry research exploring a similar issue.


#### Example

*Broad Topic*
- Real Estate Financing

*Narrow Area*
- Public Infrastructure and Land Value

*Research Question*
- How does the development of public infrastructure projects affect house prices?

*Similar research*
