Effective desciption and summaries of data is the basis for analyses and sophisticated tasks like statistical modelling. Often, checking basic point estimates of a sample, like the average, median, or mode, can give a researcher the piece of mind that the data she is studying is accurate. Describing a dataset with basic statistics is also the starting point of machine learning tasks like feature engineering. This tutorial will introduce concepts for describing data and the accompanyig terminology, that will come in handy during later more challenging examples. We will again use income data from the US Census to work through examples.
