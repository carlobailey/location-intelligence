In this first post related to Python programming I am going to start by answering perhaps the most common question asked by individuals new to writing code: "What can I do with Python?". The breadth of things you can do coding Python, is what makes the language typically appear in [top 5 programming languages for developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies). From creating a machine learning model to predict building energy consumption, creating a stock trading platform, to developing desktop games, Python is a highly versatile, general purpose programming language used by many of the technology firms around the world. This post will cover some of the fundamental concepts inherent to Python, and getting to grips with these are essential to fully grasping later more complex posts.

There are a few key concepts that are common to all [object oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) languages, variables, operators, data structures, functions and classes. Thankfully, although these concepts might seem highly abstract at the beginning, they are fairly easy to grasp in the Python language, as opposed to something like C++. Each of the aforementioned concepts are outlined in sections below.
