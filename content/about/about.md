Location Intelligence is a graduate course taught at [Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/) by Carlo Bailey, on geospatial analytics and data science. The course investigates the use of machine learning and statistical modelling to explore the
complex systems that underlie place. Going beyond predefined notions of location–cities,
counties, regions, etc.– deconstructing location into arbitrarily defined geographies, borrowing techniques from remote sensing, recommender systems, clustering, and predictive modelling to surface novel insights. These techniques, though widely used throughout the financial and tech industries, are still nascent within the industries and methods related to real estate, architecture, or urban planning. As such, the course gives students a hands-on, application first approach to geospatial analysis and data science.
